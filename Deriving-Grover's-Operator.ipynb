This comes from trying to use the source for the math mentioned here in conjunction with another source that was used to give an overview of Grover's in the presentation [Abhijith J., et al., \"Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners\" arXiv:1804.03719 quant-ph](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03719).
